There are two different data types: **Primitive** and **Non-Primitive**, due to the fact, that java is a static typed programming language.
Data types in Java define the kind of data a variable can hold and the memory required to store it.



## Primitive Data Types

Primitive types are the fundamental data types that store single values. Java defines eight primitive data types, summarised below:


## Boolean
Logical Values
Default: false
Size: JVM dependent (normally 1 bit)
Example: true - false
Range: -

## Byte
8-bit signed intenger
Size: 1-byte
Example: 10
Range: -128 - 127

## Char
16-bit Unicode character
Default: \uOOOO 
Size: 2 bytes
Range: 0 - 65,535

## Short
16-bit signed intenger
Size: 2 bytes 
Range: -32.768 - 32.767

## int
